First chapter introduces how to load 2D and 3D images, some advanced plotting methods, slicing 3D images.

Second chapter is devoted to the masks and filters.  Here we learn how to explore patterns to select sub-areas of an image and how to use filters to detect features. 

Third chapter is about image segmentation, object labeling, and morphological measurement.

Final chapter discusses basics of registration, resampling, and image comparison.

Not all images from the course are available in this repository.  

Please use your examples of images to experiment with the code.
